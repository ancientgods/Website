<h1>How to set up this project:</h1>

Firstly, install <a href="http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.2/x64/node-v0.12.2-x64.msi">node.js</a>

Now download the project, aswell as the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/NyxStudios/TShock/releases">TShock</a>

Extract the project and the tshock folder.

In the project (geck website) folder edit the config.json file and change the tshock database path.

Open command promt, and set directory to where server.js and config.json are located at.

Now type "npm install", this will install all necessary packagages.

Now type "node server.js" and the server will be running at the specified port.

In your browser type localhost://<port here> and you will be able to see the website.

Have fun contributing!

Note: It is highly recommended to make a batch file for easier start-up. Also, you can change everything but server.js, config.json and package.json without need to restart node.js to see the changes running. Just refresh the webpage.

========

This project uses Jade for webpages. Language reference at <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">jade-lang.com</a>. It is recommended to use an editor that supports Jade, CSS and JavaScript. Brackets or Visual Studio with node.js are good editors.
